	abstract = {Degenerate {UU-} and {VV-statistics} play an important role in the field of hypothesis testing since numerous test statistics can be formulated in terms of these quantities. Therefore, consistent bootstrap methods for {UU-} and {VV-statistics} can be applied in order to determine critical values for these tests. We prove a new asymptotic result for degenerate {UU-} and {VV-statistics} of weakly dependent random variables. As our main contribution, we propose a new model-free bootstrap method for {UU-} and {VV-statistics} of dependent random variables. Our method is a modification of the dependent wild bootstrap recently proposed by Shao [X. Shao, The dependent wild bootstrap, J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 105 (2010) 218–235], where we do not directly bootstrap the underlying random variables but the summands of the {UU-} and {VV-statistics.} Asymptotic theory for the original and bootstrap statistics is derived under simple and easily verifiable conditions. We discuss applications to a Cramér–von Mises-type test and a two sample test for the marginal distribution of a time series in detail. The finite sample behavior of the Cramér–von Mises test is explored in a small simulation study. While the empirical size was reasonably close to the nominal one, we obtained nontrivial empirical power in all cases considered.},

	shorttitle = {Weak Dependence},
	abstract = {This monograph is aimed at developing {Doukhan/Louhichi's} (1999) idea to measure asymptotic independence of a random process. The authors propose various examples of models fitting such conditions such as stable Markov chains, dynamical systems or more complicated models, nonlinear, non-Markovian, and heteroskedastic models with infinite memory. Most of the commonly used stationary models fit their conditions. The simplicity of the conditions is also their strength. The main existing tools for an asymptotic theory are developed under weak dependence. They apply the theory to nonparametric statistics, spectral analysis, econometrics, and resampling. The level of generality makes those techniques quite robust with respect to the model. The limit theorems are sometimes sharp and always simple to apply. The theory (with proofs) is developed and the authors propose to fix the notation for future applications. A large number of research papers deals with the present ideas; the authors as well as numerous other investigators participated actively in the development of this theory. Several applications are still needed to develop a method of analysis for (nonlinear) times series and they provide here a strong basis for such studies.},
