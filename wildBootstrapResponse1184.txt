We thank the reviewers for their comments, and for their kind assessment of our work. In particular, we agree with reviewers 1-3 regarding their suggested improvements to the clarity of the presentation, which we will implement in a final version.

We now address the additional questions of reviewer 3:

"What prevents the results of this paper from being extended to U-statistics": there is no intrinsic reason the results would not apply to U-statistics. The main advantage of the V-statistics is a simpler analysis and implementation. We will make a note of this in the final version.

"why could results of [18] not be directly used to prove Theorem 1." The results in [18] apply to statistics having two arguments. Theorem 1 extends these results to the case of m arguments. The main idea is that for these higher degree kernels, the asymptotics are dominated by the 2-argument term h_2, for which the results of Leucht are then applied.

"The proof of Theorem 1 [...] does not seem to go through for somewhat more strongly dependent processes. In particular, the mixing coefficient needs go down at least as the 6th power."

The assumptions on the mixing coefficient follow from Assumption B.1 of Leucht - hence more strongly dependent processes would require a different approach to Leucht and Neumann. It is an interesting question to look into ways to strengthen the resuslts. It is worth noting that \tau mixing is still a weaker assumption than classical mixing assumptions (Section 2).
